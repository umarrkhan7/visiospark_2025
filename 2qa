Mobile App Development Competition

Theme: UniWeek - Student Week Event Management App

Background:

Spring semester is approaching, and the university is gearing up for Student Week, a week-long celebration featuring technical, literary, and sports activities organized by three student societies:

1. ACM (Technical Society) - Handles coding competitions, coding riddles, workshops, and seminars.

2. CLS (Literature & Pop Culture Society) - Handles debates, essay competitions,

anime/season watchings, and pop culture activities.

3. CSS (Sports Society) - Handles football, cricket, and other sports tournaments.

You are tasked with developing a mobile app called UniWeek to manage student registration, event updates, and participation tracking.

Objective:

Create a mobile app prototype that allows:

Society handlers to post events, track student registrations, and update event deta

Students to browse events, register for multiple activities, and see their participation status.

The app must be user-friendly, interactive, and integrate smart features like notifications. event filtering, or Al-driven suggestions.

Key Features:

1. Society Handler Dashboard (ACM, CLS, CSS):

Event Management: Add new events, edit or delete events.

Student Registration Overview: View a list of students registered for each event.

Notifications: Push or in-app notifications to students about upcoming events. Al Assistance (Optional): Suggest event categories based on student trends or past participation.

2. Student Dashboard:

Event Discovery: Browse all events organized by ACM. CLS. and CSS.

Event Registration: Register for events with a single click.

Participation Status: See registered events, schedule, and event details.

Al Assistance (Optional): Suggest events based on student interests or past participation.

3. Event Details Page:

Event name, description, date/time, venue, society organizer (ACM, CLS, or CSS).

Registration button with confirmation.

Optional "Add to Calendar" functionality.

Additional Modules (Optional for Bonus Marks)

Following are the modules that can be added to enhance the UniWeek application. Participants are encouraged to implement as many as possible.

Important Guidelines:

1. Modules listed with "must" are mandatory and must be fully developed.

2. Modules listed with "optional" are bonus modules; if developed fully, they will provide bonus marks.

3. Each module should be fully constructed, meaning it should be functional. integrated with the existing dashboards, and interact properly with related modules (e.g., registration, notifications, or analytics).

4. Modules should be connected logically to existing features like student registration, society dashboards, and event management.

5. The number of optional modules successfully developed will be considered bonus marks, so teams are encouraged to prioritize fully functional addition rather than partially implemented features.

Here's the list of additional modules:

1. Event Filtering & Search (must)

Filter events by society, type, or date/time.

Al suggestions based on student preferences or past participation.

2. Leaderboards & Achievements (optional)

Track top participants across ACM, CLS, and CSS.

Award badges like "Top Coder" or "Star Debater."

Al can highlight participation trends.

3. Feedback & Ratings Module (must)

Students can rate events after participation.

Societies can analyze popularity or improvement areas.

Al can summarize feedback trends.

4. Group & Team Management (optional)

The app must be connected to a database to store and retrieve data.

The user interface must be intuitive, user-friendly, and visually appealing for the us

Participants should aim to develop the maximum working app within the time lim

The app should include at least one Al-powered feature such as event recommendations, summary notifications, or team suggestions (optional but recommended).

Optional modules can be implemented for bonus marks, but all mandatory fea must be fully functional first.

The final working app must be displayed on a mobile device to demonstrate fu functionality.
